# Programming Challenges
* Convert Decimal to Octal: takes in a decimal number and converts it to octal form (base 8)
* Exponentiation: Java doesn't use the caret (^) for exponents, so I created my own method
* Find Palindromes: takes in 2 numbers, and prints out the numbers between them that are palindromes
* Time Clock: allows employees to clock in and clock out using their own 4-digit PIN. More info: https://www.brianchan.me/time-clock.html
* Valid Parentheses: checks a certain set of parentheses, i.e. ((())()), and returns the number of parentheses pairs there are

Screenshots of each program are in each folder.
