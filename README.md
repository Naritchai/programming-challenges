# Programming Challenges
* Convert Decimal to Octal: takes in a decimal number and converts it to octal form (base 8)
* Exponentiation: Java doesn't use the caret (^) for exponents, so I created my own method
* Find Palindromes: takes in 2 numbers, and prints out the numbers between them that are palindromes
