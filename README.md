* Operating Systems (C): projects for Operating Systems class. Written in C.
* PlusMinus: For a list of positive integers, see if it is possible to insert plus or minus signs in front of each positive integer in the list, so that the result equals a positive integer in that list. Contains Java and Scheme implementations.
* Print Next Highest Octal Number: takes in an octal number with 8 different digits and prints out the next highest octal number with 8 different digits
* Solitaire: Command line version of popular Solitaire game (1-card draw)
* Time Clock: allows employees to clock in and clock out using their own 4-digit PIN. More info: https://www.brianchan.me/time-clock.html
